# üìÑ Resume Ranking System
# üîπ Project Overview
The Resume Ranking System is an AI-powered application that ranks resumes based on a given job description. It leverages BERT (MPNet) and T5 Transformers to calculate the relevance of each resume and provides ranked results to streamline the hiring process.

# ‚úÖ Features:

Extracts and processes text from PDF resumes.
Uses BERT (MPNet) and T5 Transformers to evaluate resume-job description similarity.
Generates Word Clouds for job descriptions and resumes.
Provides ranked resumes based on cosine similarity or T5 scoring.
Allows downloading ranked results in Excel format.

# üöÄ Technologies Used

Python 3.8+
Streamlit (For UI)
PyMuPDF (pymupdf) (For PDF text extraction)
NLTK (For text preprocessing)
BERT (MPNet) & T5 Transformer (For resume ranking)
Pandas (For data handling)
Matplotlib & WordCloud (For visualization)
